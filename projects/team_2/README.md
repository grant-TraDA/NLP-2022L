# Text Summarization â€“ Exploring Potential of PSO Usage in Hybrid Algorithms

## Requirements
To build docker image one must install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Deployment
To deploy application for text summarization using PSO with Docker, perform following steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Go to folder `NLP-2022/projects/team_2/`.
3. Run command `docker-compose up`.
4. After image is build, open in your browser website `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
5. Paste text in upper text area, click *Summarize* and text summary will appear in bottom text area.
