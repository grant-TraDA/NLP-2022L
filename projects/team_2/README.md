# Text Summarization – Exploring Potential of PSO Usage in Hybrid Algorithms

## Data
Data should be downloaded from Kaggle: [CNN-DailyMail News Text Summarization](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail).
Next, data should be extracted in directory `data`.

## Requirements
Requirements are stated in file `requirements.txt` and can be installed using `pip`
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## EDA
Explorative Data Analysis is available in Jupyter Notebook `eda.ipynb`

## Colab notebooks
In directory `colab notebooks` there are two notebooks meant to run in Google Colaboratory environment.

`matchsum.ipynb` notebooks enables to test MatchSum summarization and `calculate_rouge.ipynb` enables to calculate ROUGE scores for selected summaries.
